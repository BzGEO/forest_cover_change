## Summary
This is a collection of Google Earth Engine (GEE) code for forest cover change mapping, based on the LandTrendr algorithm from Kennedy et al. (2010) and Kennedy et al. (2018). The geographic scope of this work is the nation of Belize, and Mesoamerica (i.e., southern Mexico to Panama). The time period for the analyses is 1984 to 2025.

## Functions

As displayed below, the code repository is divided into four sections. There are scripts for:

1. Loading Landsat mosaics and derived products (spectral mixture analysis outputs, and forest cover maps),
2. Generating dry season Landsat mosaics using Kennedy et al.'s LandTrendr-based temporal stabilization algorithm,
3. Generating land cover change maps based on LandTrendr, and
4. Generating user interfaces (UIs) for producing GEE apps for visualizing the mosaics, SMA outputs, and forest cover data.
