This is a Google Earth Engine (GEE) repository of code focused on forest cover change.
The current geographic focus areas are (i) Belize, and (ii) Mesoamerica.
The code provided are based on work from Prof. Robert Kennedy of Oregon State University (OSU),
specifically his LandTrendr algorithm, and his LandTrendr-based temporal stabilization algorithm.
Those algorithms focus on mapping changes using Landsat data from NASA and the USGS.

This repository was put together by Emil Cherrington, Ph.D., of the Lab for Applied Science of the
University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH).

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at emil.cherrington@uah.edu.
